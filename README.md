**0900** - 
With no way to confirm the actual state of the world.

I'll treat the recent Asian escalation as actual and provide some guidance.

A few things surfaced early. I'll attach the notes.

The most important thing that stands out so far is this:

Framing Lai Ching-Te aka William Lai as leader of "The Republic of China" that is Taiwan is likely the West's and associated superpowers' attempt to preseed the narrative necessary to orchestrate the same chain of events they did between Russia and Ukraine; frame the war as legacy, one country wanting the other back. When they buckle, clean up the mess. 

If they continue down this path against sovereign nations they will quickly be exposed. 

China does not want Taiwan back, they are sovereign.

Uploaded a project to GitHub.com/therickyfoster/alberta_housing_tracker and the main index.html for the prioject was buried at github.com/therickyfoster/alberta_housing_tracker/tree/main/alberta/housing/tracker

I didn't want to take up unnecesary storage space and redundantly store the file twice by copying it to the main site directory: github.com/therickyfoster/alberta_housing_tracker

The solution:

Make a new index.html at the main repo link: github.com/therickyfoster/alberta_housing_tracker

Use the following code:
<!--> <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=https://therickyfoster.github.io/alberta_housing_tracker/alberta/housing/tracker">
</html> 
</!-->
