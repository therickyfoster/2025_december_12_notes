With no way to confirm the actual state of the world.

I'll treat the recent Asian escalation as actual and provide some guidance.

A few things surfaced early. I'll attach the notes.

the most important thing that stands out so far is this:

Framing Lai Ching-Te aka William Lai as leader of "The Republic of China" that is Taiwan is likely the West's and associated superpowers' attempt to pressed the narrative necessary to orchestrate the same chain of events they did between Russia and Ukraine.

If they continue down this path against sovereign nations they will quickly be exposed. 

China does not want Taiwan back, they are sovereign.
